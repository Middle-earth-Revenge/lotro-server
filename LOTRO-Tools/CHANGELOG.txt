17.03.2013	When using admin as account, you can create a pseudo character (sometimes). Parsing isn't done, so it's a random process.
14.03.2013	Client working til character creation screen. Checksum working, no patched client needed. Creation of packets is generic. You can change account file.
		Basic authentication cases working. Shop setup is not available and thrown away.
		
		todo:
			- handle missed server packets, this is essential(!!!), because sometimes client exe crashes if certain packet missed!!!
			- handle client packets after session setup(til now no need to)
			- handle character creation (chara's can't be saved, it's a lot of parsing values inside packet). People can create different
			  chara's and mark the changing values inside packet, so that we find a pattern.
			- rewrite parsing part, it's too confusing (server packets are send in a row, the real server isn't working so, he is waiting upon client response)
			  put packet handling into client session, not a general one
